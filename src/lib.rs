//![![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
//!
//!Estienne is a simple to use library for interacting with Biblical verses from text.
//!The focus of Estienne is to provide a library for building applications that need to interact with files that contain Biblical scriptures such as lecture notes.
//!No special syntax needs to be used in conjunction with scriptures in order for Estienne to parse the text successfully.
//!
//!Estienne is still in its initial stages and not ready for use.
//!
//!## The Name
//!The library is named after Robert Estienne, a French theologian of the early Christian era.
//!He is best remembered for being the first to print the New Testament divided with numbered verses.
//![Read More](https://www.jw.org/finder?wtlocale=E&docid=2016167&srctype=wol&srcid=share&par=14)
//!
//!## The Purpose
//!The purpose of the library is to provide a simple way to manipulate Biblical verses within a line of text.
//!The API will allow for easy manipulations of the verses, such as:
//!- Returning a list of verses found in a line of text
//!- Allowing a verses to be:
//!   - prefixed with arbitrary text
//!   - suffixed with arbitrary text
//!   - etc.
//!
//!## Contributing
//!Contributions are welcomed, but please be aware that the project is still in its prototype phase and large portions of code might change at any moment.
//!Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or suggestions.
