Estienne is a simple to use library for interacting with Biblical verses from text. 
The focus of Estienne is to provide a library for building applications that need to interact with files that contain Biblical scriptures such as lecture notes.
No special syntax needs to be used in conjunction with scriptures in order for Estienne to parse the text successfully. 

Estienne is still in its initial stages and not ready for use.

## The Name
The library is named after Robert Estienne, a French theologian of the early Christian era. 
He is best remembered for being the first to print the New Testament divided with numbered verses. [Read More](https://www.jw.org/finder?wtlocale=E&docid=2016167&srctype=wol&srcid=share&par=14)

## The Purpose
The purpose of the library is to provide a simple way to manipulate Biblical verses within a line of text. 
The API will allow for easy manipulations of the verses, such as:
- Returning a list of verses found in a line of text
- Allowing a verses to be:
   - prefixed with arbitrary text 
   - suffixed with arbitrary text
   - etc.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcomed, but please be aware that the project is still in its prototype phase and large portions of code might change at any moment. 
Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or suggestions.
