Estienne is a simple-to-use Rust library for finding and interacting with Biblical scripture references in text. The focus of Estienne is to provide a library for building applications that need to interact with files that contain Biblical scriptures, such as lecture notes or articles. No special syntax needs to be used in conjunction with scriptures for Estienne to parse the text successfully.

Estienne is still in its initial stages and not yet ready for production use.

## Features

- **Find Scriptures**: Automatically detect Bible scripture references in a string.
- **Surround**: Add a prefix and/or postfix to each detected scripture (e.g., for styling).
- **URL Linking**: Convert scriptures into markdown-formatted URLs pointing to an online Bible (currently supports JW.org).
- **Locale-Aware**: Designed with localization in mind (currently supports `en_us`).

## Installation

Add Estienne to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
est = "0.6.0-alpha"
```

## Usage

Here are a few basic examples of how to use Estienne.

### Surrounding a Scripture with a Prefix and Postfix

You can easily wrap any found scriptures with custom text, which is useful for formatting.

```rust
use est;

fn main() {
    let text = "A popular scripture is John 3:16, it's quoted often.";
    let formatted_text = est::surround(text, "<strong>", "</strong>");
    
    // formatted_text is now:
    // "A popular scripture is <strong>John 3:16</strong>, it's quoted often."
    println!("{}", formatted_text);
}
```

### Generating a URL for a Scripture

Estienne can convert scripture references into clickable markdown links.

```rust
use est;
use est::locales::en_us::Site;

fn main() {
    let text = "Read Revelation 21:3-4 for comfort.";
    let linked_text = est::url(&Site::JwOrg, text);

    // linked_text is now:
    // "Read [Revelation 21:3-4](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/revelation/21/#v66021003-v66021004) for comfort."
    println!("{}", linked_text);
}
```

## The Name
The library is named after Robert Estienne, a French theologian of the early Christian era. 
He is best remembered for being the first to print the New Testament divided with numbered verses. [Read More](https://www.jw.org/finder?wtlocale=E&docid=2016167&srctype=wol&srcid=share&par=14)

## The Purpose
The purpose of the library is to provide a simple way to manipulate Biblical verses within a line of text. 
The API will allow for easy manipulations of the verses, such as:
- Returning a list of verses found in a line of text
- Allowing a verses to be:
   - prefixed with arbitrary text 
   - suffixed with arbitrary text
   - etc.
