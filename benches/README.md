# Estienne
Estienne is a simple, powerful, and easy-to-use library for parsing Biblical verses. This project is still in its prototype phase, so please be patient with us as we continue to add features and improve the library.

## The Name
The library is named after Robert Estienne, a French theologian of the early Christian era. He is best remembered for being the first to print the New Testament divided with numbered verses. [Read More](https://www.jw.org/finder?wtlocale=E&docid=2016167&srctype=wol&srcid=share&par=14)

## The Purpose
The purpose of the library is to provide a simple way to manipulate Biblical verses within a text. The API will allow for easy manipulations of the verses, such as:
- Returning a list of verses found in a text
- Allowing to verses to be:
   - prefixed with arbitrary text 
   - suffixed with arbitrary text
   - URL-encoded in various markdown syntaxes
   - etc.


## Contributing
Contributions are welcome, but please be aware that the project is still in its prototype phase and large portions of code might change at any moment. Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or suggestions.
